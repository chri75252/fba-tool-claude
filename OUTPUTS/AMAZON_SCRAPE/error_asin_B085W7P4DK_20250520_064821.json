  "ai_extraction_diagnostic": "The error message:\n\n```\nBrowserType.connect_over_cdp: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9222\nCall log:\n  - <ws preparing> retrieving websocket url from http://localhost:9222\n```\n\nindicates that your automation script or tool is attempting to connect to a local Chrome Debugging Protocol (CDP) endpoint at `localhost:9222` but is unable to establish the connection because the connection is refused.\n\n---\n\n### Likely Reasons\n\n1. **Chrome/Chromium instance with remote debugging not running**\n\n   - The connection is being attempted on `127.0.0.1:9222`, but there is no browser instance running with the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) enabled on that port.\n   \n2. **Wrong or missing Chrome launch flags**\n\n   - To enable CDP on port 9222, Chrome/Chromium must be started with the `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag.\n   \n3. **Port conflict or blocked port**\n\n   - Another application might already be using port 9222, causing the browser or the tool to fail on connecting.\n   \n4. **Firewall or network restrictions**\n\n   - Although the connection is local to `127.0.0.1`, some firewall or security software could block connections to that port.\n   \n5. **Automation code issue**\n\n   - The script or automation tool might be configured incorrectly, expecting a browser to already be running with the remote debugging enabled, but none is available.\n   \n6. **Misconfigured environment**\n\n   - The environment where the script runs does not have a graphical browser or browser executable installed or accessible.\n   \n\n---\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Start Chrome/Chromium with remote debugging port**\n\n   - Launch Chrome manually with the flag:\n     ```\n     chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222\n     ```\n   - Or if you're using Puppeteer (Node.js) or Playwright, configure it to launch the browser instance with this flag or let the library manage browser launch internally.\n   \n2. **Use the automation library's browser launch functionality**\n\n   - Instead of connecting to an existing browser, automate the browser launch:\n     - In Playwright, use `playwright.chromium.launch()` or `.launchPersistentContext()` to start a browser instance.\n     - In Puppeteer, use `puppeteer.launch()` which manages this internally.\n   \n3. **Verify port availability**\n\n   - Check if port 9222 is already in use using:\n     ```\n     netstat -an | grep 9222   # Unix/macOS\n     netstat -an | findstr 9222  # Windows\n     ```\n   - If occupied, select a different port or terminate the conflicting app.\n   \n4. **Check firewall settings**\n\n   - Ensure no local firewall or security software is blocking `localhost:9222`.\n   \n5. **Correct the connection logic**\n\n   - If your automation script assumes a browser is already running with the remote debugging enabled, either start one manually or modify the script to launch it.\n   \n6. **Verify environment**\n\n   - Ensure Chrome/Chromium is installed and accessible.\n   - If running in a headless server environment, consider using a headless browser or a containerized browser solution.\n   \n7. **Alternative approach**\n\n   - If you don't specifically need to connect over CDP, use higher-level APIs to launch and control the browser directly through the automation framework.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nYour script/tool is trying to connect to Chrome DevTools Protocol at port 9222 on localhost but cannot because no browser is listening on that port. You need to:\n\n- Launch Chrome/Chromium with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` manually, or\n- Modify your automation code to launch the browser internally with the proper flags,\n- Or check for port conflicts/firewall issues.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide details about the tool or framework you're using (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium, custom scraper), I can offer more specific instructions."
