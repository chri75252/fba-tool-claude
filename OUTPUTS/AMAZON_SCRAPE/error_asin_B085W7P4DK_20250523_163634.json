  "ai_extraction_diagnostic": "The error message:\n\n```\nBrowserType.connect_over_cdp: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9222\nCall log:\n  - <ws preparing> retrieving websocket url from http://localhost:9222\n```\n\nindicates that the tool or script you're using to extract data from the Amazon ASIN page is attempting to connect to a Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) endpoint on `localhost` port `9222`, but the connection is refused. This usually means there is no browser instance listening on that port.\n\n---\n\n### Likely Reasons\n\n1. **Chrome/Chromium not started with remote debugging enabled**  \n   The error often occurs because the script expects a Chromium/Chrome instance to be running with the `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag, which opens the port to allow CDP connections. If no such browser is running or the port is blocked, connection fails with `ECONNREFUSED`.\n\n2. **Port 9222 is blocked or in use by another application**  \n   The port might be either blocked by firewall/security software or occupied already by another process, preventing the connection.\n\n3. **The script/tool is incorrectly configured**  \n   The tool or script might be configured to connect to a running browser on localhost port 9222, but no such instance is running or the URL is misconfigured.\n\n4. **Network issues or binding issues**  \n   If the environment is containerized or remote, localhost might not behave as expected or traffic might be redirected.\n\n---\n\n### Common Context & Background\n\nMany headless browser tools (e.g., Playwright, Puppeteer with connect_over_cdp) rely on an active Chrome/Chromium instance exposing the CDP interface. Usually:\n\n- You launch Chrome with `chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222`  \n- The tool connects to `http://localhost:9222/json/version` to get WebSocket endpoint  \n- Then connects over CDP protocol.\n\nIf Chrome is not running with that flag, no server is listening on port 9222, leading to `ECONNREFUSED`.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Solutions / Steps to Fix\n\n1. **Start Chrome/Chromium with remote debugging enabled**  \n   Launch Chrome manually or via script:  \n   ```bash\n   chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222\n   ```  \n   or if you are on Linux, the executable could be `google-chrome` or `chromium-browser`:  \n   ```bash\n   google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222\n   ```  \n   This will open port 9222 and allow your scraping tool to connect.\n\n2. **Ensure no firewall or security software blocks port 9222**  \n   Check if the port is open and accessible on localhost.\n\n3. **Check if the port 9222 is in use**  \n   Run:  \n   ```bash\n   lsof -i :9222\n   ```  \n   or on Windows:  \n   ```powershell\n   netstat -ano | findstr 9222\n   ```  \n   If another process occupies it, either kill that process or use a different port.\n\n4. **Verify tool configuration**  \n   Ensure the extraction tool or script is set to connect to the correct port and host.\n\n5. **Consider launching Chrome programmatically instead of connecting to an existing instance**  \n   Some scraping libraries (like Playwright or Puppeteer) support launching Chromium instances internally, which avoids needing a pre-launched browser.\n\n6. **Alternative: If inside a Docker container or remote environment**  \n   Make sure localhost:9222 is accessible. Sometimes you need to forward ports or adjust networking.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **The root cause:** The script attempts to connect to a Chromium instance on localhost port 9222 but none is running/listening.  \n- **Fix:** Start Chrome with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` before running your scraping script or adjust your scraper to launch Chrome internally.  \n- **Check port usage and firewall if problem persists.**\n\n---\n\nIf you can share more details about the tool or script you use for extraction, I can help tailor the solution further."
