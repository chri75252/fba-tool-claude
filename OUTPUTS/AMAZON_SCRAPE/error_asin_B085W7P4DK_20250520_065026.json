  "ai_extraction_diagnostic": "The error message you're encountering:\n\n```\nBrowserType.connect_over_cdp: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9222\nCall log:\n  - <ws preparing> retrieving websocket url from http://localhost:9222\n```\n\nindicates that your code or tool is trying to connect to a Chromium-based browser instance over the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) at `localhost` on port `9222`, but the connection was refused because no process is listening on that port.\n\n---\n\n### Likely reasons for this error:\n\n1. **Chromium/Chrome is not running with remote debugging enabled on port 9222.**  \n   The connection attempt expects a browser instance already running with the remote debugging port open (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`).\n\n2. **The remote debugging port is blocked or in use by another process.**  \n   Either the port is firewalled, or another application is occupying port 9222, so your client cannot connect.\n\n3. **The browser instance crashed or was closed before the connection was attempted.**  \n   If the target browser was started but exited unexpectedly, the port would not be open.\n\n4. **The code/tool configuration is incorrect or missing the instruction to launch or connect to a browser instance.**\n\n---\n\n### Possible solutions:\n\n1. **Start Chromium/Chrome with Remote Debugging enabled:**  \n   Launch the browser with this flag to open the remote debugging port:\n\n   ```bash\n   chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222\n   ```\n   or on macOS/Linux:\n\n   ```bash\n   google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222\n   ```\n   \n   Make sure the browser stays running and the port is accessible.\n\n2. **Verify the port is open and accessible:**  \n   - Use `netstat` or similar commands to check if port 9222 is listening:\n     - On Unix/Linux/macOS:\n       ```bash\n       lsof -i :9222\n       ```\n     - On Windows (Command Prompt):\n       ```cmd\n       netstat -an | find \"9222\"\n       ```\n   - If the port is not open, the browser with remote debugging is not running or not properly configured.\n\n3. **If using a headless browser automation library (like Playwright or Puppeteer), let the library launch the browser:**  \n   Libraries like Playwright and Puppeteer can launch Chromium with remote debugging enabled internally. Instead of trying to connect to a running browser, change your code to launch the browser programmatically.\n\n4. **Check your code/tool configuration:**  \n   - If you intend to connect to an existing browser, ensure that browser is launched as described.\n   - If you want the tool to launch its own instance, remove or adjust the `connect_over_cdp` connection code to launch instead of connect.\n\n5. **If running inside Docker or a remote environment, check network settings:**  \n   Port forwarding or localhost binding issues could prevent the connection.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The error means no browser instance is listening on `localhost:9222`.\n- You must either launch the browser manually with the `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag before connecting or change your code to launch the browser automatically.\n- Verify port availability and firewall settings.\n- Adjust your tool or script configuration accordingly.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you with example code for launching a browser instance with Playwright or Puppeteer to avoid this error. Just let me know!"
