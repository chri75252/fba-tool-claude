  "error": "'AmazonExtractor' object has no attribute 'connect'",
  "ai_extraction_diagnostic": "The error:\n\n```\n'AmazonExtractor' object has no attribute 'connect'\n```\n\nindicates that your code or the library you are using is attempting to call a method named `connect` on an `AmazonExtractor` object, but that method does not exist or is not implemented.\n\n### Possible reasons:\n\n1. **Library or Package Version Mismatch**  \n   You might be using an outdated or incompatible version of the library that defines `AmazonExtractor`. Perhaps in a newer version, the `connect` method was removed or renamed, or your code is trying to use functions/methods from a different version.\n\n2. **Incorrect Usage of the Library**  \n   You may have misunderstood the API or the expected workflow. For example, `connect` might be a method of a different object/class, not `AmazonExtractor`.\n\n3. **Incomplete or Custom Implementation**  \n   If `AmazonExtractor` is a custom or locally modified class, it might be missing the `connect` method altogether.\n\n4. **Typo or Code Error**  \n   Perhaps you meant to call a different method or access a different attribute.\n\n### How to fix:\n\n1. **Check the documentation or source code** of the library you are using to confirm whether `AmazonExtractor` has a `connect` method:\n   - If it doesn't, revise your code to remove or replace the `connect` call.\n   \n2. **Update the library/package** to the latest version if possible:\n   ```\n   pip install --upgrade <library-name>\n   ```\n   Sometimes bugs or missing methods are fixed in newer versions.\n\n3. **Review your code** to ensure you are using the API correctly. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   extractor = AmazonExtractor(asin='B085W7P4DK')\n   # Instead of extractor.connect(), maybe you need to call extractor.extract()\n   data = extractor.extract()\n   ```\n\n4. **Search for similar issues on GitHub or the library’s issue tracker.** This error might be a known problem with a suggested fix.\n\n5. **If you’re using a wrapper or scraper,** consider alternative libraries or methods that support Amazon product extraction.\n\n6. **Ensure network or authentication setup separately.** Sometimes libraries require initialization or session setup differently.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide the snippet of your code invoking `AmazonExtractor`, I can help find a more precise fix."
