  "ai_extraction_diagnostic": "The error message:\n\n```\nBrowserType.connect_over_cdp: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9222\nCall log:\n  - <ws preparing> retrieving websocket url from http://localhost:9222\n```\n\nindicates that your script or tool is trying to connect to a Chromium-based browser instance over the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) on localhost port 9222 but is failing because the connection is refused. This usually means that there is no browser instance listening on port 9222 or the browser isnâ€™t started correctly with remote debugging enabled.\n\n---\n\n### Likely Reasons\n\n1. **No Chromium browser instance is running with remote debugging enabled on port 9222**\n   - The debug port 9222 is the default for the Chrome DevTools Protocol. If the browser is not started with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, the connection won't be established.\n2. **Browser crashed or closed**\n   - The browser instance that was previously started might have crashed or closed, so the CDP server is no longer available.\n3. **Port 9222 is blocked or used by another application**\n   - Another process could be using port 9222, or a firewall/network restriction might be blocking access.\n4. **Incorrect configuration in your automation script**\n   - The script/tool expects a remote debugging protocol endpoint at http://localhost:9222, but if you try to connect without launching the browser, it will fail.\n5. **Version incompatibility or bugs in tooling**\n   - The Chromium version and your automation tool version might not be compatible with the expected CDP behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Solutions and Recommendations\n\n1. **Start the Chromium/Chrome browser with remote debugging mode:**\n   You need to launch Chrome or Chromium with the `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag:\n   ```bash\n   chromium-browser --remote-debugging-port=9222\n   # or on Windows\n   \"C:\\Path\\To\\chrome.exe\" --remote-debugging-port=9222\n   ```\n   This opens the port and listens for CDP connections.\n\n2. **Make sure no other process is using port 9222**\n   - Check for processes listening on 9222 (e.g., `lsof -i :9222` on Unix or `netstat -ano | findstr 9222` on Windows).\n   - Kill or reconfigure conflicting processes if any.\n3. **Modify your automation code to launch the browser instead of connecting**\n   - Often, frameworks like Playwright or Puppeteer default to launching browsers themselves. Only use `connect_over_cdp` if you have an already running browser with CDP enabled.\n   - Alternatively, use something like:\n     ```javascript\n     const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });\n     ```\n   - Instead of:\n     ```javascript\n     const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP('http://localhost:9222');\n     ```\n4. **Verify the debugging URL manually**\n   - When the browser is running with remote debugging enabled, visiting `http://localhost:9222/json/version` should return JSON metadata for the browser, including the websocketDebuggerUrl. If it returns a connection refused error, the browser is not accepting remote debugging connections.\n5. **Check your automation framework documentation**\n   - Some tools may require specific environment variables or updated code patterns to connect to Chrome via CDP.\n6. **If running in Docker or remote environment**\n   - Ensure that the port 9222 is properly exposed or forwarded and accessible.\n   - Confirm localhost is the correct host to connect from your script.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nYour script tries to connect to a Chrome/Chromium browser over CDP at localhost:9222, but nothing is listening on that port. You need to:\n\n- Ensure a Chrome instance with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` is running, or\n- Change your automation to launch a browser instance directly instead of connecting, or\n- Fix network/port issues blocking the connection.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide what automation framework or library you're using (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright, Selenium with CDP), I can provide more tailored instructions."
