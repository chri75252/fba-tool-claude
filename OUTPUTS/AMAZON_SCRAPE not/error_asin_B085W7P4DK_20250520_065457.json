  "ai_extraction_diagnostic": "The error message:\n\n```\nBrowserType.connect_over_cdp: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9222\nCall log:\n  - <ws preparing> retrieving websocket url from http://localhost:9222\n```\n\nindicates that your program (likely a Playwright or Puppeteer script) is trying to connect to a Chromium browser via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) at `localhost:9222`, but the connection is refused because there is no browser instance listening on that port.\n\n---\n\n### Likely Reasons\n\n1. **No Chromium instance running with remote debugging enabled**  \n   - To connect over CDP, a Chromium browser must be launched with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`. If this is not running, the connection is refused.\n\n2. **Wrong or missing browser endpoint**  \n   - Your code is trying to connect to `localhost:9222`, but no compatible browser is running or your browser is running on a different port.\n\n3. **Firewall/antivirus blocking the connection**  \n   - Unlikely for localhost, but antivirus or firewall software can sometimes block connections.\n\n4. **Browser crashed or closed**  \n   - The browser session may have been terminated, so connection is refused.\n\n5. **Port already in use or misconfigured**  \n   - Another application is using port 9222, or the browser launched remote debugging on a different port.\n\n---\n\n### Possible Solutions\n\n1. **Start a Chromium browser with remote debugging enabled**\n\n   Launch Chromium or Chrome with the command line flag:\n\n   ```\n   chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222\n   ```\n\n   or for Chromium:\n\n   ```\n   chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222\n   ```\n\n   Make sure this browser instance remains running before your script tries to connect to it.\n\n2. **Verify that port 9222 is open**\n\n   On your machine, check:\n\n   - Linux/macOS:\n\n     ```\n     netstat -an | grep 9222\n     ```\n\n   - Windows:\n\n     ```\n     netstat -an | findstr 9222\n     ```\n\n   You should see the port listening.\n\n3. **If you manage the browser automation, consider launching the browser from your script**\n\n   Instead of connecting over CDP to an external browser, you might launch a browser directly using Playwright or Puppeteerâ€™s API. This avoids needing manual remote debugging.\n\n4. **Check the URL being accessed**\n\n   Open `http://localhost:9222/json/version` in a browser to see if the DevTools endpoint is available.\n\n5. **Change your automation to fallback or retry**\n\n   - If the connection is refused, handle the error by either starting the browser or waiting for it to become ready.\n\n6. **Check for conflicting processes**\n\n   Ensure no other service occupies port 9222 unexpectedly.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- The error means **no browser with remote debugging on port 9222 is running**.\n- Solution is to **start a browser with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag**, or change your automation to launch its own browser instead of connecting to a manually launched one.\n- Make sure the port is open and accessible.\n- Verify connectivity by opening `http://localhost:9222` in a browser.\n\n---\n\nIf you share your code snippet or your automation framework setup, I can help you adjust it accordingly."
