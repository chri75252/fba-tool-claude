  "ai_extraction_diagnostic": "The error message you're encountering:\n\n```\nBrowserType.connect_over_cdp: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9222\nCall log:\n  - <ws preparing> retrieving websocket url from http://localhost:9222\n```\n\nindicates that the code or tool you are using is attempting to connect to a Chromium-based browser (like Chrome or Edge) via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) on your local machine at port 9222, but the connection is refused because nothing is listening on that port.\n\n---\n\n### Likely Reasons\n\n1. **No browser instance running with remote debugging enabled:**  \n   The ChromeDevTools Protocol (CDP) connection on port `9222` requires a browser instance to be running with the flag `--remote-debugging-port=9222`. If this is not running, the connect attempt is refused.\n\n2. **Port 9222 is blocked or in use:**  \n   Sometimes firewall or another application might block or occupy port 9222, causing connection failure.\n\n3. **Mismatch in configuration:**  \n   Your tool or script expects an already running browser with remote debugging but it wasn't started properly or at all.\n\n4. **Incorrect assumptions about environment:**  \n   For example, running a headless scraper expecting a browser running separately, but you need to launch the browser yourself in your code.\n\n5. **Network / localhost binding issue:**  \n   If the connection should go to a remote host or docker container but is pointed at localhost incorrectly.\n\n---\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Start Chrome/Chromium with remote debugging enabled:**\n\n   Before running your data extraction, launch the browser manually with:\n\n   ```bash\n   chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222\n   ```\n\n   or for Chromium:\n\n   ```bash\n   chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222\n   ```\n\n   This will start the browser listening on port 9222 for incoming CDP connections.\n\n2. **Modify your extraction setup to launch the browser properly:**\n\n   Instead of connecting to an already running browser on port 9222, many libraries (like Playwright, Puppeteer) can launch their own browser instance. For example, in Playwright, use:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const browser = await chromium.launch();\n   ```\n\n   rather than connecting to an existing endpoint.\n\n3. **Check if port 9222 is free:**\n\n   On Linux/macOS:\n\n   ```bash\n   lsof -i :9222\n   ```\n\n   On Windows:\n\n   ```powershell\n   netstat -aon | findstr 9222\n   ```\n\n   If another process is occupying or blocking the port, free it or use another port.\n\n4. **Verify firewall or security software:**\n\n   Ensure that local connections to localhost:9222 are not blocked.\n\n5. **Check your script or tool configuration:**\n\n   If your code uses something like:\n\n   ```javascript\n   chromium.connectOverCDP('http://localhost:9222')\n   ```\n\n   you need to make sure that instance is launched with remote debugging enabled beforehand.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes\n\n- If your extraction tool expects to connect to a remote browser already running, and this is not intentional, consider switching to launching a browser instance programmatically.\n\n- For headless scraping of Amazon pages, launching an isolated browser instance via Playwright or Puppeteer is usually more reliable than connecting to an existing browser via CDP.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Problem:** No browser listening on localhost:9222 → connection refused.\n- **Fix:** Launch a browser with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` before connecting or change your code to launch browser instances instead of connecting to them.\n- **Verify port availability** and firewall settings.\n- **Confirm your tool’s expected browser connection approach** and align your setup accordingly.\n\nIf you provide more details about the tool or code you are running, I can suggest more specific fixes."
